YCanvas is an open source ActionScript 3 library that provides stage3D (GPU) engine for perfectly overlapping grid based zooming projects like world maps or [http://onboard.yoz.sk onBoard] or simply a ''tile maps renderer''.

You can see [http://ycanvas.yoz.sk/explorer Ycanvas explorer demo live on ycanvas.yoz.sk] ([http://ycanvas.yoz.sk/explorer/?debug=true +stats]) to compare the speed of original implementation vs. YCanvas, or browse repository for sources to understand the simplicity of implementation of 3rd party systems:

The engine is optimized for rendering speed as well as for relasing unused system resources. While GPU api for flash player requires textures at width and height at power of two, you can reach the best performance when using 256x256 or 512x512 source images etc.
