YCanvas is an open source ActionScript 3 library that provides stage3D (GPU) engine for perfectly overlapping grid based zooming projects like world maps or [http://onboard.yoz.sk onBoard] or simply a ''tile maps renderer''.

Repository content:

* '''ApplicationDemo''' - sources for simpliest YCanvas implementation demonstrating implementation over Open Street Map available live on http://ycanvas.yoz.sk/demo
* '''ApplicationExplrorer''' - sources for YCanvas explorer available on http://ycanvas.yoz.sk/explorer
* '''ApplicationMarkers''' - sources for YCanvas explorer available on http://ycanvas.yoz.sk/markers
* '''ApplicationRemotair''' - sources for YCanvas with Remotair available on http://ycanvas.yoz.sk/remotair/ . This app lets you remote controll YCanvas application with [http://remotair.yoz.sk Remotair]. Uses multitouch (two-finger) gestures to move, scale, rotate
* '''bin''' - compiled binaries
* '''YCanvasLibrary''' - sources for YCanvas library

You can see [http://ycanvas.yoz.sk/explorer Ycanvas explorer demo live on ycanvas.yoz.sk] ([http://ycanvas.yoz.sk/explorer/?debug=true +stats]) to compare the speed of native implementation vs. YCanvas, or browse repository for sources to understand the simplicity of implementation of 3rd party systems:

The engine is optimized for rendering speed as well as for relasing unused system resources. While GPU api for flash player requires textures at width and height at power of two, you can reach the best performance when using 256x256 or 512x512 source images etc.
